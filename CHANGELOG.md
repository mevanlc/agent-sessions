# Changelog

All notable changes to Agent Sessions will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Cockpit active-session detection now expands `codexActiveRegistryRootOverride` before launching shim commands, so `~`-based overrides point to the same path used by active-session discovery and active badges/focus remain accurate.
- Cockpit process probing now respects the configured probe cooldown even when registry snapshots are empty, preventing unnecessary process probes on idle systems.

## [2.6] - 2025-11-14

### Added
- Usage probe support for Codex CLI:
  - Automatic tmux-based /status probes when usage data goes stale
  - New Usage Probes preferences pane with full control over probe behavior
  - Configurable refresh intervals (30/60/120 minutes, default 60)
  - 24-hour rolling probe budget to prevent excessive token usage
  - Auto-delete probe sessions option with manual cleanup controls
  - Probe session filtering from UI and analytics
  - "Last updated" timestamps with 30-minute freshness threshold
- Analytics flip cards:
  - Interactive flip cards for all analytics charts with insights and sparklines
  - Agent breakdowns and detailed context on card backs
  - Unified Sessions/Messages toggle shared across all charts
  - Per-agent message totals keep visualizations synchronized
- Enhanced usage tracking UX:
  - Separate refresh intervals for Codex and Claude
  - "Show system probe sessions for debugging" toggle
  - Menu bar clarity improvements for refresh costs

### Fixed
- Git Context Inspector now responds to Light/Dark/System theme changes immediately
- Analytics window now immediately follows System appearance changes even when not key
- Analytics: Claude sessions now use stable logical ID from `sessionId`, preventing session splitting
- Analytics: Gemini sessions also use stable logical ID from `sessionId` when present
- Analytics: Sessions and Messages totals now honor "Hide zero/low message sessions" preferences
- Analytics: Stat card tooltips now explain percentage deltas and date range comparisons
- Codex probe reliability with robust /status capture, retry logic, and scroll handling
- Claude probe hardening with better error handling and cleanup

### Improved
- Launch loading UX with better progress indicators and analytics gating
- Analytics card layouts with balanced spacing and visual hierarchy
- Probe session detection accuracy with working directory validation
- Menu bar UX with clearer refresh cost indicators

## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-04

### Major Release - Unified Interface & Claude Code Support

Agent Sessions 2.0 is a **complete rewrite** with a unified interface for managing both Codex CLI and Claude Code sessions. This release includes advanced search capabilities, dual usage tracking, and significant performance improvements for large sessions.

### Added

- **Unified window** for Codex + Claude with source toggle (Both / Codex / Claude)
- **Claude Code support**: Full parsing, transcript rendering, unique usage tracking (5h/weekly), and Resume for Claude sessions (Terminal/iTerm, configurable in Preferences)
- **Inline toolbar Search**: Magnifying-glass button expands to search field; Option+Command+F opens and focuses instantly
- **Search progress strip** under sessions table showing phase and counters during two-phase pipeline
- **Context menu action**: "Open Session in Folder" for quick file reveal (works even when Finder hides system files)

### Changed

- **Search v2**: Cancellable, incremental, two-phase pipeline (small files first; large deferred), no preview text, strict source toggle enforcement
- **Default display** for not-yet-loaded sessions shows file size in Msgs column (instead of "Many")
- **Exclude filters** in Preferences now apply instantly (no app reload); "Skip agents.md lines" enabled by default for titles/initial view
- **Titles and transcript start** skip common preambles (agents.md and Claude "Caveat..." blocks); auto-scroll jumps to first conversational line

### Improved

- **Large session performance**: Lazy hydration, off-main parsing, defer-until-needed loading for ≥10 MB logs
- **Unified search UX**: Batch streaming of results, keystrokes cancel immediately, promote-on-open prioritizes clicked large session
- **Focus and keyboard flow**: Inline search auto-focuses on open, collapses when empty on click/tab away; no unexpected focus steals from list
- **Visual polish**: Tighter spacing, aligned usage strips and progress meters

### Fixed

- Prevented Find field from stealing focus when navigating list
- More reliable selection behavior during initial load and when switching rows
- Finder reveal now works for hidden session files

### Documentation

- Updated v2 notes and UI tooltips across Sessions, Transcript, and Preferences
- Clarified behaviors including Transcript vs Terminal and all Find controls

### UI

- Inline search with clear button that cancels search and collapses back to magnifying-glass
- Compact progress line communicates "Scanning small/large … x/y" during searches
